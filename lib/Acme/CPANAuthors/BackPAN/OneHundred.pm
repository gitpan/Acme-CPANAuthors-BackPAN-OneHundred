=head1 NAME

Acme::CPANAuthors::BackPAN::OneHundred - The CPAN Authors who have 100+ distributions on BackPAN

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a hash of CPAN authors' PAUSE ID and name to be 
used with the C<Acme::CPANAuthors> module.

This module was created to capture all those CPAN Authors who have valiantly
submitted their modules and distributions to CPAN, and now have the honour of
having submitted 100 or more distributions to CPAN. 

Note that the CPAN authors listed here may not be maintaining 100 or more
distributions on CPAN, but have submitted 100 or more distributions to PAUSE, 
where some older distributions may have been deprecated or adopted by other 
authors. The numbers here represent the number of distributions a CPAN author 
has listed on BackPAN.

See L<http://backpan.cpantesters.org>.
